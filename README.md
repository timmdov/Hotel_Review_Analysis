This project explores the use of **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** for extracting insights from hotel reviews. Online reviews significantly impact hotel bookings, pricing strategies, and brand perception. While commercial platforms like **ReviewPro** and **TrustYou** offer basic analytics, they are often inaccessible to smaller or independent hotels, and lack emotional or cognitive depth.

This project aims to fill that gap by building an **affordable, detailed sentiment analysis solution** using open-source ML and NLP tools.
