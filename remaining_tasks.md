# Hotel Review Analysis Project - Remaining Tasks

## Overview
This document outlines the remaining tasks for the Hotel Review Analysis project. These tasks are organized by category and priority based on the current state of the project.

## 1. Review Clustering & Topic Modeling

### High Priority
- [ ] Implement review clustering algorithm (K-means or hierarchical clustering)
- [ ] Apply Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling
- [ ] Create topic visualization (pyLDAvis)
- [ ] Implement BERTopic as an alternative to traditional LDA
- [ ] Evaluate and compare different clustering approaches

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Develop method to automatically label clusters with meaningful names
- [ ] Create functions to extract representative reviews from each cluster
- [ ] Implement time-based analysis of topic evolution

## 2. Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA)

### High Priority
- [ ] Implement aspect extraction from reviews (e.g., service, cleanliness, location)
- [ ] Develop aspect-specific sentiment scoring
- [ ] Create aspect-sentiment visualization

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Build comparative analysis of aspects across different hotels
- [ ] Implement aspect-based recommendation system

## 3. Dashboard Development

### High Priority
- [ ] Design dashboard layout and components
- [ ] Implement basic dashboard using Streamlit or Dash
- [ ] Create sentiment distribution visualizations
- [ ] Add topic/cluster visualization component

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Implement hotel comparison feature
- [ ] Add time-series analysis of sentiment trends
- [ ] Create downloadable reports feature
- [ ] Add user authentication if needed

## 4. Model Improvements

### High Priority
- [ ] Fine-tune BERT model specifically for hotel domain
- [ ] Implement multilingual support for non-Turkish reviews
- [ ] Create ensemble model combining multiple approaches

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Implement cross-validation for more robust evaluation
- [ ] Optimize model hyperparameters
- [ ] Add confidence scores to sentiment predictions

## 5. Data Pipeline Enhancements

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Improve data preprocessing pipeline efficiency
- [ ] Add more robust error handling
- [ ] Implement incremental processing for new reviews
- [ ] Create automated data quality checks

## 6. Testing & Documentation

### High Priority
- [ ] Write unit tests for core functionality
- [ ] Create end-to-end tests for pipelines
- [ ] Complete code documentation with docstrings
- [ ] Update README with latest features and usage instructions

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Create user guide for dashboard
- [ ] Document API if exposing functionality as services

## 7. Deployment

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Containerize application with Docker
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Prepare cloud deployment strategy (AWS/GCP/Azure)
- [ ] Implement monitoring and logging

## Next Steps Recommendation

1. Start with implementing the review clustering and topic modeling, as this appears to be the most immediate need
2. Proceed with dashboard development to visualize current results
3. Implement ABSA to provide more granular insights
4. Enhance models and pipelines based on initial feedback
